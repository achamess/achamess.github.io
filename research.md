# Research

My current projects focus on the following areas: 

- The role of the innate immune receptor [NOD2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/64127) in the pathogenesis of chronic neuropathic and inflammatory pain.
- Therapeutic use of the pro-resolving lipid mediator [Maresin 1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maresin) for pain and nerve regeneration.
- Genetic factors contributing to chronic pain after nerve injury in human populations.
