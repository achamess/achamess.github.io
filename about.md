I am a 5th year MD-PhD student in the [Medical Scientist Training Program](http://mstp.duke.edu) at the [Duke University School of Medicine](http://dukemed.duke.edu). Currently, I am pursuing my PhD work under [Dr. Ru-Rong Ji](http://www.neuro.duke.edu/training-faculty/phd-training-faculty/ru-rong-ji) in the Pain Signaling and Sensory Plasticity Laboratory here at Duke. 

I received a BS in Biochemistry from [Stony Brook University](http://www.stonybrook.edu) in 2009. I then came to Duke Med to begin my medical education in 2010. In Fall 2012, I began my graduate studies through the Department of Pharmacology and Cancer biology at Duke. 

I am broadly interested in understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of nociception, with an emphasis on chronic pain. In addition, as an aspiring physician-scientist, I aim to direct my research efforts towards questions of high clinical relevance.

My current projects focus on the following areas:  

- The role of the innate immune receptor NOD2 in the pathogenesis of chronic neuropathic and inflammatory pain
- Therapeutic use of the pro-resolving lipid mediator Maresin 1 for pain and nerve regeneration
- Genetic factors contributing to chronic neuropathic pain in human populations
